'Inventing Abstraction 1910-1925' is an interactive web map that displays artists that contributed to the invention of abstract art. The map highlights the major artists involved at the start of the movement: Vasile Kandinsky, Frantisek Kupka, Francis Picabia, and Robert Delaunay and then traces their influence on other artists throughout the concept's beginnings.

The web displays the most influential artists and their pieces as one cohesive collection. It does not only include traditional media such as painting, but mix media, sculptures, music, books, films, dance, and photography. This wide range of media allows for the project to act as an in depth search into the invention of abstraction and a wonderful foundation for beginners who wish to discover more and delve deeper into the world of abstract art. 

The project is readily accessible to the public and is a digital edition of the MoMA Galleries in person exhibition. A ‘checklist’ is provided on the site that allows viewers to see a breakdown of all of the pieces of art in simple terms and acts as a guide throughout the web. There is also an option on the project to download the web directly to your personal computer. However, the site does not show what kind of technology was used in its creation. Although this is a negative, the site does provide a lengthy list of credits and publication information that describes in depth the experience that each contributor brought to the table.

The layout is aesthetic and complex to the eye. To combate the complexity tools provided such as the zoom function and the interactivity of clicking on each artist, makes the project easy to navigate. It’s a very simple design, with the web being the only interactive part, while the remaining information is in written format. It would have been beneficial to include hyperlinks in the artist’s bio that lead to informative pages about the artists or other exhibitions they’ve been a part of. This would have given the audience a chance to explore other sources and not just the web with its limited information.

The web itself can seem overwhelming, but once you choose an artist to read about, it zooms you in to that specific artist and whichever other artists they are connected with. The project also provides pictures of each artists’ work and, when clicked on, the images enlarge for closer inspection.

While the written information provided on the artists is full bodied and well researched, it is only given on the 13 main artists. This makes it difficult for the audience to comprehend the connections the map is trying to establish.

While the web is well-put together and shows artistic connections, it is difficult to see the spread of abstraction. It would be more clear to the audience if a timeline was added. This would give a background of the history rather than just information about the artist.

Inventing Abstraction is a beautiful project and a piece of art itself. However, flaws involving the lack information and no definitive timeline leaves the audience wanting. By adding information on each artist rather than only a select few, the project would feel more complete and further the audience’s ability to explore the topic. The path of abstraction would be more clear with the addition of a simple timeline. Overall, the project completes its purpose of bringing together the talented and diverse artists that founded the movement.
