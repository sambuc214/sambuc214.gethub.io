*My name is Sam Buchholz...

...I’m a junior at Christopher Newport University and I’m working towards a Marketing major alongside a minor in Leadership Studies. 
While I’m not pursuing anything directly labeled as Digital Humanities, I am interested in becoming a more _concise_, articulate communicator and writer, and fulfilling a WI isn’t a bad perk _at all_.
I don’t plan on going to graduate school, at least not at the moment. It’s my hope to move out of Virginia once I graduate to either San Diego or Seattle and start working towards some of my career goals there. I would love to work for a non-profit, however I don’t have my eye on any particular company. 
My main interest is product marketing. My experience in sales at Mattress Firm combined with my current job at Thompson Creek Window company as a field marketer has allowed me to narrow down my interest in the marketing field. The final push I needed was my discussion with PIR’s, Public Interest Registry, (Visit PIR)[https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2019/12/the-sale-of-pir-the-internet-society-board-perspective/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-uH6BRDQARIsAI3I-UduLmyWZ5Xo5SdJnIm3vDphT1rxQdfmhslbiYefmr4vwKFoFDeULQ8aAi6MEALw_wcB] Marketing VP, who broke down the strengths and weaknesses needed in product marketing vs. brand marketing for me. 
A minor in Leadership has also proven to be beneficial in both my academic career and positions I’ve held in the past. It’s not something that I thought would be offered at a university, but the classes have become some of my _absolute favorites_ during my time here. I believe they’ve broadened my understanding of the relationship between leaders, followers, and the situation, and will act as a *backbone* to my marketing success.
I’ve been involved in the Presidential Leadership Program at CNU and have come to enjoy volunteering at the Peninsula of the Fine Arts Center, a local gallery in association with the school, [you should really check them out](https://pfac-va.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-uH6BRDQARIsAI3I-Uf3urgB8fySdKoJBTCtBcQBmXPJpZ2D-R1RHkeTI48bA7A354_DmhIaAmKqEALw_wcB). I lead tours of the exhibits and also work in the gift shop.
I am an artist as well, mainly with oil paints, and have been commissioned several times. I was also able to take figure painting classes at [SAIC](https://pfac-va.org/classes/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-uH6BRDQARIsAI3I-UeB9vj86ARQ3BL3_eLbSu-MoIavc2hUawbuyt5YHu46Z3ZPF_Wns6YaAvJzEALw_wcB) and had my work shown at the Sullivan Galleries. I was also blessed with the opportunity to observe the final stages of the National Geographic team in Reston, VA as they put the final touches on the cover layout of the magazine’s, [The Photo Ark](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/activity/endangered-species-and-their-biomes/).
