# TEI Coding Blog




I was assigned page 654, column 1 of “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The short story follows the mental and physical decline of a woman who is bed ridden with an unknown sickness in her new home. Overtime, the woman displays signs of mental illness and spends her waking hours obsessing over the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. 

Her relationship with her husband John, a doctor, is showcased in his belittlement of her and her illness, which he patronizes and uses to control her actions. As her “illness” proceeds to grow worse, John forces her to stay in her room for the remainder of their time in the house. This quarantine plays a large role in her mental health troubles and increases her instability as well as her growing relationship with the wallpaper.

Page 654 depicts the woman’s descent into hysteria as she describes what the wallpaper looks like and how it consumes her. She uses colorful language and imagery when speaking about the wallpaper, and gives it an almost life-like presence, claiming that its smell follows her around the house as if the wallpaper itself is capable of movement.

The passage is very straightforward in its use of punctuation, and contains only seven em-dashes and two italicized words. This made marking up the passage in Google Docs very simple. The piece also included a misspelled word that I needed to mark in order to note the mistake but also preserve the originality of the piece. Other than the em-dashes and italics, the passage had a large number of paragraphs which, although make the piece easier to read, required more time in the markup process. Taking the time to markup the piece without having to worry about coding right away made the TEI process a lot less complicated or intimidating.

I had never used Oxygen before and was apprehensive about the task. However, practicing markup in Google Docs allowed for a smooth transition into coding. Luckily, as I mentioned above, there was not a lot of marking up to be done for this particular passage, just the italics, the paragraph breaks, the em-dashes, and the misspelled word. 

I did have an issue with coding the italics. When I pasted in the code, it would automatically add an ending ```</emph>``` to the line, which doubled up at the end of my code, causing it to not work. It took me more time than I care to admit to figure this out, but once I did it was pretty smooth sailing. The only other minor problem I encountered was when I put in the code for an em-dash, Oxygen added a space in between ```&#8212;``` which made it to where the em-dash was not flush with the words like in the original passage. 

The concept of the code is fairly straightforward. All I had to do was make sure my tags had a start point and an end point and just put the text in between them. I was nervous to start actually coding but the limited number of tags needed for my section alongside our practice in Google Docs boosted my confidence. I am looking forward to use Oxygen in the future
